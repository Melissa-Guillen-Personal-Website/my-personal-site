# my-personal-site
# Created my first personal website with three HTML pages (index, about, and portfolio) a CSS file and a Javascript file. 
#index.html contains the home page, about.html contains the about me page, and portfolio.html contains the projects/ work page.
#the CSS file is incorporated in all three html pages and the Javascript file contains the "hello world" routine.
